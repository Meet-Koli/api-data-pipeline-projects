# 📊 API Data Pipeline Projects

This repository contains a collection of **API-based data ingestion and validation projects** built using Python.  
Each project focuses on fetching structured data from external APIs, validating it, handling errors, and storing clean outputs for further use.

The goal is to build **reliable, production-style data pipelines** that follow real-world engineering practices.
